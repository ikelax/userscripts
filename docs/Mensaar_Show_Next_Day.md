# Mensaar Show Next Day

A userscript that switches to the meal plans for the next
day when the canteen has already closed for today.

On a Monday after 2:30 pm, it will show the meal plan for
Tuesday (if the canteen is opened). Before 2:30 pm, it will
show the meal plan for Monday. The time in Germany is used
to determine this.
